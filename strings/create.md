## Creation

You can define strings in JavaScript by enclosing the text in single quotes or double quotes:

```js
// Single quotes can be used
var str = 'Our lovely string';

// Double quotes as well
var otherStr = "Another nice string";
```

**Note:** Strings can not be substracted, multiplied or divided.

Create a variable named `str` set to the value `"abc"`.

```js

```

```js
var str = 'abc';
```

```js
assert(str === 'abc');
```
