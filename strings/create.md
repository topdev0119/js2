## Creation

```js
// Single quotes can be used
var str = 'Our lovely string';

// Double quotes as well
var otherStr = "Another nice string";
```

**Note:** Strings can not be substracted, multiplied or divided.

---

Create a variable named `str` set to the value `"abc"`.

```js

```

```js
var str = 'abc';
```

```js
assert(str === 'abc');
```

---

### Transforming objects to strings with .toString()

Most javascript objects such as `Number`s can be transformed into strings using the `.toString()` method.

---

Create a variable named `numstr` that is a string transformed from the `num` variable.

```js
var num = 27;
```

```js
var num = 27;
var numstr = 27.toString();
```

```js
assert(numstr === '27');
```
