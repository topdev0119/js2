# Comments

Comments are statements that will not be executed by the interpreter, comments are used to mark anotations for others programmers or to make it easy to understand your code in the future.

In Javascript, comments can be written in 2 different ways:

* Line starting with `//`:

```js
// This is a comment, it will be ignored by the interpreter
var a = "this is a variable defined in a statement";
```

* Section of code starting by `/*`and finishing by `*/`, this method is used for multi-lines comments:

```js
/*
This is a multi-lines comment,
it will be ignored by the interpreter
*/
var a = "this is a variable defined in a statement";
```

Mark the all editor content as a comment

```js
Mark me as a comment
or I'll throw an error
```

```js
/*Mark me as a comment
or I'll throw an error*/
```

```js
assert(true);
```
