# Numbers

JavaScript has only one type of numbers, it does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc. A number could be a **Float** (ex: 1.23) or an **Integer** (ex: 10).

There is nothing magical or strange going on with these. You define variables and set their values to any number type.

In this chapter, we'll learn how to create number and do some operations on them (like additions and subtractions).
